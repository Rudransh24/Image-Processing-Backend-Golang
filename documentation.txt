This is an image processing backend assignment made using Golang with proper error handling and a random sleep time to imitate GPU processing

Installation
sudo apt install golang go
sudo snap install postman

Testing
postman
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
go run main.go
Using Postman, get and post requests
GET Request: To determine whether our job_id exists or not
POST Request: To find out the dimensions of images mapped to a store_id, if it is present in the csv file

Work Environment
Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Text Editor - Ubuntu
Postman
Libraries:
	    "encoding/csv"
	    "os"
	    "fmt"
	    "math/rand"
	    "time"
	    "log"
	    "net/http"
	    "encoding/json"
	    "strconv"

	    "io/ioutil"
	    "image"
	    _ "image/gif"

If we are given more time, a proper UI can be formed and some frontend image uploading feature/buttons can be added to directly find the image perimeter
